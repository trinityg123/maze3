"""
Parameter definitions for the intersects module:

A point is defined by a list or tuple in the form [x, y] or (x, y).

A circle is defined as a list or tuple in the form [x, y, r] 
where (x, y) represents the center of the circle and r is its radius.

A rect is defined as a list or tuple in the form [x, y, width, height] 
where (x, y) represents the coordinates of the upper left corner of 
the rectangle.
